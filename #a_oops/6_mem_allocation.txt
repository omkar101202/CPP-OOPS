cpp/c contain both sma and dma


memory allocation
1)sma
static memory allocation (here 'static' is not related with the static keyword in cpp )
here memory is allocated is to variables by deleclation statements (in compile time its scope and life time is decided)
e.g. int x;
     float y;  etc.

2)dma
dynamic memory allocation
these are formed by calling function not by decleration (calling func is a action not decleration).
there is no name of these variables ,they are accessed by using pointers.
e.g. malloc()
     free()

in cpp we use-->
instead of malloc or calloc->>>____use "new"
and ues "delete"

new is a operator.it denotes a request of memory allocation from heap.
==> int *p=new int;
    float *ptr=new float[size]

==> delete p;
    delete []ptr;

**>at runtime memory allocation is non contigous.
