in cpp file is deled by using certain classes-
like, ofstream->stream class to write on file
      ifstream->stream class to read file
      #fstream->streamclass to both write and read from files

##cin and cout are the obj of iostream class whick are already made to take input from our keyboard and display on our moniter.
but for reading and writing we have to make different(new) objects of ifstream/ofstream class to read/write in/on different files.(thats why we are given authority to create the object of these classes that we may need to deal with many files at a time so for that we need different objects of these classes).

-->>at the end we must close the files / ................
